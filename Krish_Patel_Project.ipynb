This means that for every 10-mile increase in distance to the nearest college, the average number of years of completed education decreases by approximately 0.073 years. The p-value is extremely small, much lower than all significance levels (0.10, 0.05, and 0.01). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels. This indicates that the slope coefficient is statistically significant and that the distance to the nearest college has a meaningful impact on educational attainment. In conclusion, the data provides strong evidence that being farther from a college decreases the number of years of completed education."
